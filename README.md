# Catch Of The Day

![App preview](../images/appPreview.png)

**This app allows the user to:**
* Update an Order, update the fish on the Menu, update the Inventory and even change stores while having the ability to store the data that was already entered in a different store!
  * REACT is awesome!!!!
* I learned to use keys to store values in localStorage, and new ES6 syntax/magic in order to cut down on code when retrieving the value from an input!
